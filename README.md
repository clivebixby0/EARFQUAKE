## Project Description
The Eartquake Data Analysis Tool is a Streamlit web application designed to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Machine Learning to analyze earthquake data. This tool allows users to explore seismic activity trends, visualize data, and make predictions regarding earthquake risks based on various features.

## 📖 Pages:
* `Dataset` - Brief description of the Global Earthquake dataset used in this dashboard, including key features such as magnitude, depth, location, and more.
* `EDA` - Exploratory Data Analysis of the earthquake dataset, highlighting distributions and relationships between features. Includes visualizations such as density plots, scatter plots, and violin plots.
* `Data Cleaning / Pre-processing` - Steps for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, including encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
* `Machine Learning` - Training of various supervised models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Classifier, to predict earthquake magnitudes and tsunami occurrences. Includes model evaluation metrics and feature importance analysis.
* `Prediction` - A prediction page where users can input values to predict earthquake risk levels based on the trained models.
* `Conclusion` - Summary of insights and observations from the EDA and model training.
